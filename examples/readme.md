## Convert TensorFlow model to Core ML model format

Following topics are discussed in the Jupyter notebooks:

- **[deep_speech.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/deep_speech.ipynb)**

An example to freeze and convert a popular [TensorFlow implementations of deep speech model](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech).

- **[inception_v1_preprocessing_steps.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/inception_v1_preprocessing_steps.ipynb)**

An example to generate a classifier model with image input types and the importance of properly setting the preprocessing parameters.

- **[inception_v3.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/inception_v3.ipynb)**

An example to strip the `DecodeJpeg` op from the TensorFlow graph to prepare it for the conversion.

- **[linear_mnist_example.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/linear_mnist_example.ipynb)**

An example to get a frozen graph from the checkpoint and graph description files generated by training in TensorFlow.

- **[ssd_example.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/ssd_example.ipynb)**

An example to extract a portion of the TensorFlow graph that can be converted, from the overall graph that may have unsupported ops.

- **[style_transfer_example.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/style_transfer_example.ipynb)**

An example to edit a Core ML model to get an image output type (by default the outputs are `MultiArrays`).

- **[tf_keras_fashion_mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/tf_keras_fashion_mnist.ipynb)**

An example to train, evaluate, and test a simple model using [fashion MNIST](https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/fashion-mnist/) dataset from scratch with `tf.keras` in TensorFlow 2+ and convert it to Core ML format.

- **[tf_low_level_apis.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/tf_low_level_apis_example.ipynb)**

A few examples to define a simple model using low-level APIs or `@tf.function()` in TensorFlow 2+, save the model, and convert it to Core ML format.

- **[custom_layer_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/custom_layer_examples.ipynb)**

A few examples to demonstrate the process of adding custom Core ML layers for unsupported TensorFlow ops.
